## Generate x-vector speaker embeddings using SpeechBrain.
This notebook is designed to generate **speaker embeddings** from the Arabic Speech Corpus Dataset using a pre-trained speaker recognition model SpeechBrain's x-vector. The extract_spk_embedding.py file is from the ESPnet github repo  

##Usage
Run the notebook to generate the speaker embeddings. If you are using Arabic Speech Corpus Dataset for ESPnet training use the _train_speaker_embedding_ and _test_speaker_embedding_ folders which contain the generated speaker embeddings.
